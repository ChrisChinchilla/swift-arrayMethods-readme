> We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..


```swift
var names = ["Jim", "Mike", "Paul"]
names.insert("Brian", atIndex: 3)


let index = names.indexOf("Jim")!
names[index] = "No longer Jim"




// append()
// contains()
// insert(_:atIndex:)
// indexOf()



// count
// isEmpty

names.count
names.isEmpty


// appendContentsOf()
// removeAll()
// popLast()
```

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().

## Outline / Notes

*  Need to complete this. The student will not have read about structs or classes (yet) so I don't want to go to deep in an explanation of computed properties and instance methods but I think we might need to give them a short definition as they will be using them fully in this reading.
* I like the idea of having them open a playground file typing out the various properties and methods I want to discuss above (which I need to outline better) and see what the return types are, get familiar with the signature and what these methods want to take in as arguments.
